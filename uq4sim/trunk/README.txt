== DESCRIPTION:
  
To document model parameter uncertainties and to automate
sensitivity analyses for numerical modeling and simulation
codes, a natural-language-based method to specify tolerances
has been developed.  With this new method, uncertainties
are expressed in a natural manner, i.e., as one would on
an engineering drawing, namely, 5.25+/-0.01.

This approach is robust and readily adapted to various application
domains because it does not rely on parsing the <em>particular</em>
structure of input file formats.  Instead, tolerances of a standard
format are added to existing fields within an input file.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:
  
* Provides in situ documentation of model parameter uncertainties.
* Readily adapted to existing modeling and simulation codes.
