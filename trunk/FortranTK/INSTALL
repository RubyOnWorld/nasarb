PREREQUISITES

1) A Fortran 90 compiler.

2) The Ruby language. The source is available from http://www.ruby-lang.org/

INSTALLATION

Currently everything in the src directory needs to be in your
working directory.  This will change to something more sane soon...

Set the F9X environment variable to your Fortran compiler of choice.
(FTKtest will explain how to do this if it is not set.)
