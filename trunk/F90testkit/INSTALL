PREREQUISITES

1) A Fortran 90 compiler.

2) The Ruby language -- the source is available from http://www.ruby-lang.org/

INSTALLATION

Place the src/F90test Ruby script in a directory searched by your path,
e.g., ~/local/bin or have your System Administrator place it
somewhere more global like /usr/local/bin.

Set the F9X environment variable to your Fortran compiler of choice.
(The script will explain how to do this if it is not set.)
