FortranTK (Fortran Test Kit)

 A Fortran9X mobility-testing framework (aka a unit-testing framework).

RUN ALL TESTS:

 GatherTests
 make

RUN SPECIFIC TEST(S):

 GatherTests FluxFunctions [...]
 make

OVERVIEW:

 We are given a directory containing Fortran9X routines, i.e., *.f90
 files.  Also included are corresponding *Test.ftk files which contain
 a mixture of Fortran9X commands and Fortran Toolkit commands used
 to test the corresponding Fortran9X routines.

 The GatherTests Ruby script translates the Fortran Toolkit files
 into valid Fortran9X routines and creates a program called TestRunner.f90
 which, after compilation and linking, runs the tests.

MANIFEST:

 GatherTests   - a Ruby script which expands the assertion macros
                 in the test code(s), generates the Fortran90 test-
                 runner code, and compiles, links, and runs the tests.
 *.f90         - sample Fortran routines to be tested.
 *Test.ftk     - corresponding mobility test suites with FortranTK macros.

TODO:

 o Assertion/test counters
 o Summary of test results
 o Add date checks to compile
