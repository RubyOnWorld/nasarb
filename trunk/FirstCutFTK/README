 The beginnings of a Fortran90 mobility testing framework.

RUN ALL TESTS:

 make

RUN SPECIFIC TEST(S):

 GatherTests FluxFunctions [...]
 make

OVERVIEW:

 (Too lazy to write this now.)

MANIFEST:

 FTK.f90     - module which holds global variables and definitions
 FTK.h       - macro definitions which are expanded via the compiler
               pre-processor

 Makefile    - compiles and runs the tests

 GatherTests - Ruby script which generates the Fortran test runner
               code and a file which is included by the Makefile to
               define which tests are to be compiled.

 *.f90       - sample Fortran routines
 *Test.F90   - corresponding mobility tests
