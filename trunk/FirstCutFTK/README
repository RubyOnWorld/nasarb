FortranTK (Fortran Test Kit)

 A Fortran9X mobility-testing framework (aka a unit-testing framework).

RUN ALL TESTS:

 GatherTests
 make

RUN SPECIFIC TEST(S):

 GatherTests FluxFunctions [...]
 make

OVERVIEW:

 We are given a directory containing Fortran9X routines, i.e., *.f90
 files.  Also included are corresponding *Test.ftk files which contain
 a mixture of Fortran9X commands and Fortran Toolkit commands used
 to test the corresponding Fortran9X routine.

 The GatherTests Ruby script translates the Fortran Toolkit files
 into valid Fortran9X routines and spits out the proper makefile
 targets to a file named TestBits.mk which is included in the
 resident Makefile.

 The user then runs make and the test suites are run.

MANIFEST:

 FortranTK.f90 - module which holds global variables and definitions

 Makefile      - compiles and runs the tests

 GatherTests   - a Ruby script which expands the assertion macros
                 in the test code(s), generates the Fortran90 test-
                 runner code, and a file which is included by the
                 Makefile to define which tests are to be compiled,
                 linked, and run.

 *.f90         - sample Fortran routines to be tested
 *Test.ftk     - corresponding mobility test suites with FortranTK macros

TODO:

 o Assertion/test counters
 o Summary of test results
 o Obviate make for compile
 o Run tests
