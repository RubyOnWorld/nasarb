FortranTK (Fortran Test Kit)

 A Fortran9X mobility-testing framework (aka a unit-testing framework).

RUN ALL TESTS:

 GatherTests
 make

RUN SPECIFIC TEST(S):

 GatherTests FluxFunctions [...]
 make

OVERVIEW:

 [Need.]

MANIFEST:

 FortranTK.f90 - module which holds global variables and definitions

 Makefile      - compiles and runs the tests

 GatherTests   - a Ruby script which expands the assertion macros
                 in the test code(s), generates the Fortran90 test-
                 runner code, and a file which is included by the
                 Makefile to define which tests are to be compiled,
                 linked, and run.

 *.f90         - sample Fortran routines to be tested
 *Test.F90     - corresponding mobility test suites with FortranTK macros

TODO:

 o Assertion/test counters
 o File and line number output for assertion failures
