FortranTK (Fortran Test Kit)

 A Fortran9X mobility-testing framework (aka a unit-testing framework).

RUN ALL TESTS:

 RunTests
 make

RUN SPECIFIC TEST(S):

 RunTests FluxFunctions [...]
 make

OVERVIEW:

 We are given a directory containing Fortran9X routines, i.e., *.f90
 files.  Also included are corresponding *Test.ftk files which contain
 a mixture of Fortran9X commands and Fortran Toolkit commands.  These
 *Test.ftk files provide tests for the corresponding Fortran9X routines.

 The RunTests Ruby script translates the Fortran Toolkit files
 into valid Fortran9X routines and creates a program called TestRunner.f90
 which, after compilation and linking, runs the tests.

MANIFEST:

 RunTests     - a Ruby script which converts the *Test.ftk pseudo-Fortran
                test suites into pure Fortran, generates the Fortran test-
                runner program, and then compiles, links, and runs the tests.
 *.f90        - Fortran routines to be tested.
 *Test.ftk    - corresponding mobility test suites.
 FTK-mode.el  - minor mode for syntax highlighting FortranTK files with emacs

TODO:

 o Assertion/test counters
 o Timing data for tests
 o Summary of test results
 o Add dependency checks to compile, e.g., module under test having use modules
 o Only recompile what's necessary
 o Green/red bar
