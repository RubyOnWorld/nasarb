= FUnit: a Fortran Unit Testing Framework

FUnit is a unit testing framework for Fortran modules.

Unit tests are written in Fortran fragments that use a small
set of testing-specific extensions.  FUnit transforms these
fragments into valid Fortran code and compiles,
links, and runs them against the module under test.

== Documentation

 http://funit.rubyforge.org

== Requirements

1. A Fortran 90/95/2003 compiler (set via F9X environment variable)
2. {The Ruby language}[http://www.ruby-lang.org/]
3. {RubyGems package manager}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/]

== Installation

 gem install funit

== License

FUnit is released under the NASA Open Source Agreement -- see
COPYING for details.

== Support

== To Do

* Make tests so that they fail gracefully if Fortran compiler
  not found.
* Work out RubyGEM packaging kinks.
* Change from CamelCase to snake_case.
* Use 'test' keyword instead of 'beginTest' business.
* Clean up documentation.
* To increase portability, create a single, stand-alone executable with
  Erik Veenstra's RubyScript2Exe[http://www.erikveen.dds.nl/rubyscript2exe/].
