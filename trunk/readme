FTK  --  Fortran Test Kit

The Genesis:

On October 4, 2001, Mike Hill of Object Mentor, Inc. visited ICASE
for a talk on Test First Design.  He spent the afternoon with Bil Kleb,
Bill Wood, Karen Bibb, and Mike Park working out a strategy to build a
testing framework for fortran90.  We decided to try out a strategy 
built around writing test routines that could easily be written in 
a psuedo-fortran style, and then (automatically, of course) assimilated and
processed (via cpp or a script) into an executable test program.

Our initial try (with improvements?) is included in the FirstCutFTK 
directory.  We'll see where that goes from here.
