A BRIEF HISTORY

On October 4, 2001, Mike Hill of Object Mentor, Inc. visited NASA
Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia and gave a test-first
design talk at Institute for Computer and Applied Sciences and
Engineering (ICASE).

Mike spent the afternoon with Bil Kleb, Bill Wood, Karen Bibb,
and Mike Park reasoning out how we might create a testing framework
for Fortran 90.  By the end of the afternoon we had a working
protoype based on the macro expansion techniques employeed in
Mike's own cpptestkit.

The basic idea is that test routines should easily be written in 
a psuedo-Fortran style (i.e., very lightweight), processed (via
the c preproccesor or a script) into valid Fortran90, collected, and
invoked by a dynamically-created/compiled/ linked/run Fortran90 code
named testrunner.
