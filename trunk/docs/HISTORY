= A Brief History

On October 4, 2001, Mike Hill (then of Object Mentor, Inc.)
visited NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia
and gave a test-first design talk at Institute for Computer
and Applied Sciences and Engineering (ICASE).  Copies of his
slides are availabe at http://www.icase.edu/series/MPP/.

Mike spent the afternoon with Bil Kleb, Bill Wood, Karen Bibb,
and Mike Park reasoning out how we might create a testing framework
for Fortran 90.  By the end of the afternoon we had a working
protoype based on the macro expansion techniques employeed in
Mike's cpptestkit.

The basic idea is that test routines should easily be written in 
a psuedo-Fortran style (i.e., very lightweight), processed (via
the C preproccesor or a script) into valid Fortran90, and invoked
by a master, test-runner Fortran 90 code, which is dynamically-
created, compiled, linked, and run.
